[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/manoelcampos/Design-Patterns-with-Lambdas-in-Java8.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/manoelcampos/Design-Patterns-with-Lambdas-in-Java8)

This project aims to provide implementations of different Design Patterns using Lambda expressions in Java 8.
A Maven project with the current implemented patterns is provided in the [src](src) directory.
Each pattern implementation is provided into a specific package containing an usage example named Exanmple.java.

The table of contents below provides direct links to the currently implemented patterns.

This project was inpired and adapted from [Design Patterns In Kotlin](https://github.com/dbacinski/Design-Patterns-In-Kotlin) by [Dariusz Baci≈Ñski](https://twitter.com/dbacinski).
It's a working in progress and [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome! :smile:
